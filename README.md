# my_vimrc
My version of vim configuration file. It should work for both Windows and Unix version of vim and does not require any special plugins. There are some usefull mappings for managing buffers, tabs and windows, yanking and pasting text even between different TTYs, automatically adding closing brackets and other useful stuff I use daily when programming. There is also my definition of statusline with colourful mode indication. All of this I wrote  myself, it is mostly based on vim documntation and some credit goes to some stackoverflow.com answers. Feel free to use this file or get inspired by this when writing your own file. This file should be saved under your home directory (User folder in case of MS Windows) and should be called .vimrc under Linux or _vimrc in case of Windows. VIM is very powerful tool and to get the most out of it you need to configure it to behave the way you want and need :)
